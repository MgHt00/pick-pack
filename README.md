# Pick Pack

This project is for my own e-commerce store, Myanmar Lifestyle. The purpose of the program is to check product SKUs (barcodes) when packing an order to ensure the correct product is shipped to the customer. The code is written for the web version, but we plan to convert it into an app for internal use within our organization.
